    <p>Mark has been employed at Burger King for two years and he lives in Barelas. He commutes on his bicycle with a ten
    ride to Lomas. His manager will only give him a part time position and has no other formal training to look for another
    job. He makes ends meet, but consistently pays child support for his two daughters that live in Texas. The payments are 90%
    of his income. He is forced to skip dinner, he can't make trips to the laundromat as often sd he'd like, and continuously
     wont have enough money to buy a full weeks worth of groceries. Mark just can't seem to make time for government assistance,
     he works during the day. Mark remains positive and knows that he can makes things work if he just had a little help.<p>
