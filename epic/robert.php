					<li>Occupation: Entrepreneur</li>
					<li>Location: Northwest Albuquerque</li>

					<li>Tech: iPhone X and Windows surface running windows10</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Robert grew up in a single parent household where he didn't get to eat every meal. His mother worked hard
				and he saw the struggle his mother went through. He now is in a position to give back to the local Albuquerque
				community, specifically to those in his prior position. He wants to teach his kids the value in giving to those who aren't as fortunate.
				Being that Robert is very busy with work and family, he doesn't have a lot of time to jump through hoops
				and obstacles to donate and give back. Robert uses this app to donate simply, fast and on a regular basis. </p>
			<h2>Goals</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Donate fast and often</li>
					<li>Build character for his kids</li>
					<li>Wants to be in control of his donations</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Frustrations</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Consistently running out of time to donate</li>
					<li>Not knowing where to donate</li>
					<li>Lack of public resources</li>
				</ul>
