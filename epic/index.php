				<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
				<p>A service that allows users to set up and donate to hubs around the city. These hubs will
					provide various supplies and goods to lower income and in need people. Users can either create
					a profile to set up hubs on their own, and can appoint people to manage and oversee those hubs,
					or can anonymously and easily donate to the hubs. The hubs will have centralized locations so that
					those without easy internet access will know how to access them. The hubs will take in anything
					users are willing to donate, and can supply everything from food to blankets and clothes and
					everything in between.</p>
