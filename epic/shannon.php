			<p>It is in Shannon's nature to help others. She is an active member of several community outreach groups. She engages in community service along with her two daughters often. Shannon became dissatisfied working with previous nonprofit organizations. The large structure, actions, and questionable ethical choices were what turned her off. She believes those issues could be fixed by a more personal approach. In short, she thinks that direct donation and assistance is the best way for her to help. </p>
